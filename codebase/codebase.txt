The points are called eggbux, with the points users can buy a bunch of commands that do different things on the server or buy some roles to receive passive income during time.
Every ten seconds that an user spends in a discord call that has the bot in the server, it gives one eggbux. The user always starts with zero eggbux.
The goal of this bot is to ensure all guild members have equal opportunities by providing access to the same purchasable custom commands and roles.
